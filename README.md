# Variants

## Command Line
### Installing
1. Ensure you have the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. run `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor.Cli`

This adds `RecursiveExtractor` to your path so you can run it directly from the shell.

### Running
Basic usage is: `RecursiveExtractor --input archive.ext --output outputDirectory`

<details>
<summary>Detailed Usage</summary>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li><i>input</i>: The path to the Archive to extract.</li>
    <li><i>output</i>: The path a directory to extract into.</li>
    <li><i>passwords</i>: A comma separated list of passwords to use for archives.</li>
    <li><i>allow-globs</i>: A comma separated list of glob patterns to require each extracted file match.</li>
    <li><i>deny-globs</i>: A comma separated list of glob patterns to require each extracted file not match.</li>
    <li><i>raw-extensions</i>: A comma separated list of file extensions to not recurse into.</li>
    <li><i>no-recursion</i>: Don't recurse into sub-archives.</li>
    <li><i>single-thread</i>: Don't attempt to parallelize extraction.</li>
    <li><i>printnames</i>: Output the name of each file extracted.</li>
    
</ul>

For example, to extract only ".cs" files:
```
RecursiveExtractor --input archive.ext --output outputDirectory --allow-globs **/*.cs
```

Run `RecursiveExtractor --help` for more details.

## .NET Standard Library
Recursive Extractor is available on NuGet as [Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor/). Recursive Extractor targets netstandard2.0+ and the latest .NET, currently .NET 6.0 and .NET 7.0.

### Usage

The most basic usage is to enumerate through all the files in the archive provided and do something with their contents as a Stream.

```csharp
using Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor;

var path = "path/to/file";
var extractor = new Extractor();
foreach(var file in extractor.Extract(path))
{
    doSomething(file.Content); //Do Something with the file contents (a Stream)
}
```

<details>
<summary>Extracting to Disk</summary>
<br/>
This code adapted from the Cli extracts the contents of given archive located at `options.Input`
to a directory located at `options.Output`, including extracting failed archives as themselves.

```csharp
using Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor;

var extractor = new Extractor();
var extractorOptions = new ExtractorOptions()
{
    ExtractSelfOnFail = true,
};
extractor.ExtractToDirectory(options.Output, options.Input, extractorOptions);
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Async Usage</summary>
<br/>
This example of using the async API prints out all the file names found from the archive located at the path.

```csharp
var path = "/Path/To/Your/Archive"
var extractor = new Extractor();
try {
    IEnumerable<FileEntry> results = extractor.ExtractFileAsync(path);
    await foreach(var found in results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(found.FullPath);
    }
}
catch(OverflowException)
{
    // This means Recursive Extractor has detected a Quine or Zip Bomb
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>The FileEntry Object</summary>
<br/>
The Extractor returns `FileEntry` objects.  These objects contain a `Content` Stream of the file contents.

```csharp
public Stream Content { get; }
public string FullPath { get; }
public string Name { get; }
public FileEntry? Parent { get; }
public string? ParentPath { get; }
public DateTime CreateTime { get; }
public DateTime ModifyTime { get; }
public DateTime AccessTime { get; }
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Extracting Encrypted Archives</summary>
<br/>
You can provide passwords to use to decrypt archives, paired with a Regular Expression that will operate against the Name of the Archive to determine on which archives to try the passwords in each List.

```csharp
var path = "/Path/To/Your/Archive"
var directory
var extractor = new Extractor();
try {
    IEnumerable<FileEntry> results = extractor.ExtractFile(path, new ExtractorOptions()
    {
        Passwords = new Dictionary<Regex, List<string>>()
        {
            { new Regex("\.zip"), new List<string>(){ "PasswordForZipFiles" } },
            { new Regex("\.7z"), new List<string>(){ "PasswordFor7zFiles" } },
            { new Regex(".*"), new List<string>(){ "PasswordForAllFiles" } }

        }
    });
    foreach(var found in results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(found.FullPath);
    }
}
catch(OverflowException)
{
    // This means Recursive Extractor has detected a Quine or Zip Bomb
}
```
</details>

## Exceptions
RecursiveExtractor protects against [ZipSlip](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability), [Quines, and Zip Bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb).
Calls to Extract will throw an `OverflowException` when a Quine or Zip bomb is detected and a `TimeOutException` if `EnableTiming` is set and the specified time period has elapsed before completion.

Otherwise, invalid files found while crawling will emit a logger message and be skipped.  RecursiveExtractor uses NLog for logging.

## Notes on Enumeration

### Multiple Enumeration
You should not iterate the Enumeration returned from the `Extract` and `ExtractAsync` interfaces multiple times, if you need to do so, convert the Enumeration to the collection of your choice first.

### Parallel Enumeration
If you want to enumerate the output with parallelization you should use a batching mechanism, for example:

```csharp
var extractedEnumeration = Extract(fileEntry, opts);
using var enumerator = extractedEnumeration.GetEnumerator();
ConcurrentBag<FileEntry> entryBatch = new();
bool moreAvailable = enumerator.MoveNext();
while (moreAvailable)
{
    entryBatch = new();
    for (int i = 0; i < BatchSize; i++)
    {
        entryBatch.Add(enumerator.Current);
        moreAvailable = enumerator.MoveNext();
        if (!moreAvailable)
        {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (entryBatch.Count == 0)
    {
        break;
    }

    // Run your parallel processing on the batch
    Parallel.ForEach(entryBatch, new ParallelOptions() { CancellationToken = cts.Token }, entry =>
    {
        // Do something with each FileEntry
    }
}
```

### Disposing During Enumeration
If you are working with a very large archive or in particularly constrained environment you can reduce memory/file handle usage for the Content streams in each FileEntry by disposing as you iterate.

```csharp
var results = extractor.Extract(path);
foreach(var file in results)
{
    using var theStream = file.Content;
    // Do something with the stream.
    _ = theStream.ReadByte();
    // The stream is disposed here from the using statement
} 
```

# Feedback

If you have any issues or feature requests (for example, supporting other formats) you can open a new [Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/RecursiveExtractor/issues/new).  

If you are having trouble parsing a specific archive of one of the supported formats, it is helpful if you can include an sample archive with your report that demonstrates the issue.

# Dependencies

Recursive Extractor uses a number of libraries to parse archives.

* [SharpZipLib](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib)
* [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress)
* [DiscUtils](https://github.com/discutils/discutils)
