Recursive Extractor is a Cross-Platform .NET Standard 2.0/2.1 Library for parsing archive files and disk images, including nested archives and disk images.

Recursive Extractor is available on NuGet as [Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor/).

You can try out Recursive Extractor [in your browser](https://microsoft.github.io/RecursiveExtractor/) as a Web Assembly app.

# Variants

## Browser
You can try out Recursive Extractor [in your browser](https://microsoft.github.io/RecursiveExtractor/) as a Web Assembly app.

## Cli
First ensure you have the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Then run `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor.Cli`

Then you can run: `RecursiveExtractor --input archive.ext --output outputDirectory`
<details>
<summary>Detailed Usage</summary>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li><i>input</i>: The path to the Archive to extract.</li>
    <li><i>output</i>: The path a directory to extract into.</li>
    <li><i>passwords</i>: A comma separated list of passwords to use for archives.</li>
    <li><i>allow-filters</i>: A comma separated list of regexes to require each extracted file match.</li>
    <li><i>deny-filters</i>: A comma separated list of regexes to require each extracted file not match.</li>
</ul>

For example, to extract only ".cs" files:
```
RecursiveExtractor --input archive.ext --output outputDirectory --allow-filters .cs$
```

Run "RecursiveExtractor --help" for more details.

## Library
Recursive Extractor is available on NuGet as [Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CST.RecursiveExtractor/).

This code adapted from the Cli extracts the contents of given archive located at `options.Input`
to a directory located at `options.Output` and prints the relative path of each file inside the archive.

```csharp
var extractor = new Extractor();
var extractorOptions = new ExtractorOptions()
{
    ExtractSelfOnFail = true,
    Parallel = true,
};
foreach(var result in extractor.ExtractFile(options.Input, extractorOptions))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.Combine(options.Output,
        Path.GetDirectoryName(result.FullPath)?
            .TrimStart(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar) ?? string.Empty));

    using var fs = new FileStream(Path.Combine(options.Output,result.FullPath), FileMode.Create);
    result.Content.CopyTo(fs);
    Console.WriteLine("Extracted {0}.", result.FullPath);
}
```
<details>
<summary>Async Usage</summary>
<br/>
This example prints out all the file names found from the archive located at the path.

```csharp
var path = "/Path/To/Your/Archive"
var extractor = new Extractor();
try {
    IEnumerable<FileEntry> results = extractor.ExtractFileAsync(path);
    await foreach(var found in results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(found.FullPath);
    }
}
catch(OverflowException)
{
    // This means Recursive Extractor has detected a Quine or Zip Bomb
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>The FileEntry Object</summary>
<br/>
The Extractor returns `FileEntry` objects.  These objects contain a `Content` Stream of the file contents.

```csharp
public Stream Content { get; }
public string FullPath { get; }
public string Name { get; }
public FileEntry? Parent { get; }
public string? ParentPath { get; }
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Extracting Encrypted Archives</summary>
<br/>
The Extractor returns `FileEntry` objects.  These objects contain a `Content` Stream of the file contents.You can provide passwords to use to decrypt archives, paired with a Regex that will operate against the Name of the Archive.

```csharp
var path = "/Path/To/Your/Archive"
var extractor = new Extractor();
try {
    IEnumerable<FileEntry> results = extractor.ExtractFile(path, new ExtractorOptions()
    {
        Passwords = new Dictionary<Regex, List<string>>()
        {
            { new Regex("\.zip"), new List<string>(){ "PasswordForZipFiles" } },
            { new Regex("\.7z"), new List<string>(){ "PasswordFor7zFiles" } },
            { new Regex(".*"), new List<string>(){ "PasswordForAllFiles" } }

        }
    });
    foreach(var found in results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(found.FullPath);
    }
}
catch(OverflowException)
{
    // This means Recursive Extractor has detected a Quine or Zip Bomb
}
```
</details>

## Exceptions
RecursiveExtractor protects against [ZipSlip](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability), [Quines, and Zip Bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb).
Calls to Extract will throw an `OverflowException` when a Quine or Zip bomb is detected.

Otherwise, invalid files found while crawling will emit a logger message and be skipped.  RecursiveExtractor uses NLog for logging.
